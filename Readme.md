# Installation
Git-clone this project into your `~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/` folder and restart ST2.

# Usage
Press `Ctrl+Alt+Y`(`Super+Alt+Y` on Mac) and start typing Yaml key names.  
Example:

    hello:
      nice:
        world: Hi
    goodbye:
      cruel:
        world: Bye

Just type `ni wo` to get to the nice world line.
